# White-Wine
Exploratory analysis of the White Wine dataset.
The goal is to best describe the variation in different types of wine available to the consumers.
We find the correlation of each attribute in the data to pose a hypothesis and perform feature selection and feature relevance,
further we performed A/B Hypothesis testing where data is chosen at random to determine which variation gives a better result. 
Feature scaling was implemented to convert the raw data into a normal distributed one using natural logarithm scaling, 
few outliers were detected during the process and had to be removed.
Further feature transformation was implemented using “Principal Component Analysis” to draw conclusions about the underlying structure, 
which dimensions about the data best maximizes the variance of features involved and also explains the variance ratio of each dimension. 
Findings are visualized using various plots such as Biplot and Clusters.
